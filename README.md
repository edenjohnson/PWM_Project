# PWM_Project
The PWM is created based off of training data, or a set of model sequences and is utilized to score any additional sequences and compare it to training data. A higher score output by the PWM tells us that the sequence is relatively similar to the training data. This project was divided into three major parts and files; obtaining the training data itself, creating the PWM with probabilities with pseudo counts and log-odd scores, and finally scoring any given sequence as input and comparing it to the PWM.
